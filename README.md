Professional passionate about the technology area, focused on spreading the Software Quality culture and the Shift Left concept to the entire team, I have worked as a QA on agile projects with the Scrum and Kanban frameworks. I have experience in manual and automated testing, from planning test coverage and writing test cases in Gherkin (BDD) and step by step, to continuous integration with Jenkins. Furthermore, it is my responsibility to monitor the evolution of tests, record and manage bugs, and actively participate in rituals and ceremonies with the team and stakeholders.
